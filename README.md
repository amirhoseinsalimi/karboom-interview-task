# karboom-quiz

This is the test task that I had to do for Karboom technical interview. The role that I had applied for was "Front-end (Vue.js) Developer" (Tir, 1400).


# Rules

- Use `yarn` for dependency management
- Use `SCSS` for styling
- Use `axios` for API calls
- Use `flexbox` for setting the layout
- Use `rem` and `em` whenever possible
- Don't use any CSS framework or UI Kit
